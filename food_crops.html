        <h2>Food Crops</h2>
        <div class="category">
            <p>Crops that are grown to feed human populations are called food crops. There are a number of food crops grown in the country, some of the most important ones are:</p>
            <img src="./rice.jpg" alt="Rice">

            <h3>Rice</h3>

            <div id="resultrice"></div>
            <p>Rice is predominantly a Kharif crop. It covers 1/3rd of the total cultivated area of India. It provides food to more than half of the Indian population.

                Rice is produced in almost all states, but the most popular ones are West Bengal, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh. Other rice-growing states include Tamil Nadu, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, and so forth. It is also grown in Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, and so forth. Rice requires about 150-300 cm of rainfall and deep clayey and loamy soil. The average temperature required throughout the life period ranges from 21 to 37°C. Crop of rice is grown by various methods like dry or semi-dry upland cultivation, broadcasting seeds, sowing the seeds behind the plow, and so forth.

            <div id="result"></div>
            <p>Wheat is the second most important crop in India following rice. It is part of the rabi crop and is a staple food in north and northwestern India. It is a winter crop and needs low temperatures and the ideal temperature for its cultivation is between 10-15°C at the time of sown and 21-26°C at the time of harvest.

                Wheat grows well in rainfall less than 100 cm and more than 75 cm. The most suitable soil for the cultivation of wheat is well-drained fertile loamy soil and clayey soil. The top three wheat-producing states are Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana.

            <div id="result"></div>
            <p>Coarse cereals and millets are short-duration warm-weather crops used for both food and fodder. Important millets are Jowar, Bajra, Ragi, and so forth. They are grown in areas with high temperatures and are called dryland crops because rainfall of 50-100 cm is required for their growth. They can be grown in an inferior alluvial or loamy soil. The top three states for their production are Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Rajasthan.

        <strong>Downy Mildew - Pseudoperonospora cubensis:</strong> 
        Treatment: Downy mildew doesn't like warm or dry weather. Organic controls include trying 3 parts of milk to 10 parts of water or one tablespoon of baking soda into one litre of water. Mix either option into a spray container and spray the affected foliage weekly.<br><br>

        <strong>Powdery Mildew - Podosphaera xanthii:</strong> 
        Treatment:
        - Mix 1 tablespoon baking soda with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon dish soap in 1 gallon of water.
        - Mix 4 tablespoons baking soda with 2 tablespoons of Murphy’s oil soap in 1 gallon of water.
        - Mix 2 to 3 tablespoons vinegar with 1 gallon of water. Be sure to test this first because vinegar can burn plants.
        - Neem is an organic fungicide. Follow instructions on the label.
        - Mix 1 part milk with 10 parts water.
        - Some folks swear by mouthwash as an effective fungicide but it is not organic. They recommend 1 cup mouthwash to 3 cups of water.<br><br>

        <strong>Anthracnose - Colletotrichum orbiculare:</strong> 
        Treatment: The most effective fungicides for control are the protective fungicides containing chlorothalonil (e.g., Daconil), copper sprays containing copper diammonia diacetate (e.g., Liquicop), propiconazole (e.g., Banner Maxx II), and the systemic fungicide thiophanate-methyl (e.g., Cleary's 3336, for professional use only).<br><br>

        <strong>Alternaria leaf spot - Alternaria cucmerina:</strong> 
        Treatment: Avoid overhead watering to limit leaf wetness, and allow enough space at planting time for good air circulation and ample sun penetration. Keep your garden free of fallen leaves all season, and especially thorough at fall cleanup time.<br><br>

        <strong>Fusarium Wilt - Fusarium oxysporum:</strong> 
        Treatment: Fusarium wilt diseases are best controlled by using resistant or tolerant cultivars, not by using soil applied fungicides. Liming soils and using nitrate nitrogen fertilizer have been effective for management of F. oxysporum on chrysanthemum, aster, gladiolus, cucumber, tomato, and watermelon.<br><br>

        <strong>Bud Necrosis disease - Watermelon bud necrosis orthotospovirus (WBNV):</strong> 
        Treatment: For the management of WBNV in watermelon, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) module has been devised which reduced the thrips population and WBNV incidence to a great extent besides increasing the fruit yield.

        <strong>Anthracnose - Colletotrichum gloeosporioides:</strong> 
        Treatment:
        - Cultural Practices: Prune infected branches and remove fallen fruit to reduce the disease's source. Maintain proper spacing between trees to improve air circulation. 
        - Fungicides: Apply appropriate fungicides before the flowering season to prevent infection. Regular spraying during fruit development is also effective. For better control Spray.<br><br>

        <strong>Guava Wilt - Fusarium oxysporum:</strong> 
        Treatment:
        - Resistant Varieties: Choose guava varieties resistant to Fusarium wilt. 
        - Soil Sterilization: Solarize or steam-sterilize the soil before planting to kill pathogens. 
        - Fungicides: Fungicidal drenches may help control the disease in severely affected trees. 
        - Proper Irrigation: Ensure adequate but not excessive soil moisture, as overly wet conditions can exacerbate wilt.<br><br>

        <strong>Powdery Mildew - Oidium psidii:</strong> 
        Treatment:
        - Pruning: Prune affected branches to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration. 
        - Sulfur-Based Fungicides: Apply sulfur-based fungicides as a preventive measure. 
        - Neem Oil: Neem oil can also be effective in managing powdery mildew.<br><br>

        <strong>Bacterial Wilt - Erwinia psidii:</strong> 
        Treatment:
        - Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plants promptly. 
        - Avoid Overhead Irrigation: Use drip irrigation to prevent splashing of bacteria. 
        - Copper-Based Sprays: Apply copper-based bactericides as a preventive measure. 
        - Resistant Varieties: Consider planting guava varieties known for their resistance to bacterial wilt.<br><br>

        <strong>Rust - Puccinia psidii:</strong> 
        Treatment:
        - Fungicides: Apply copper-based fungicides during the rainy season to prevent rust. 
        - Pruning: Remove and destroy severely infected leaves and branches. 
        - Proper Spacing: Ensure adequate spacing between trees for better air circulation.<br><br>

        <strong>Root-Knot Nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.:</strong> 
        Treatment:
        - Soil Solarization: Solarize the soil before planting guava to reduce nematode populations. 
        - Resistant Varieties: Choose guava varieties that are less susceptible to root-knot nematodes. 
        - Nematode-Resistant Cover Crops: Incorporate nematode-resistant cover crops into your orchard management plan.

        <strong>Gray Mold - Botrytis cinerea:</strong> 
        Treatment: Neem oil is one of the best natural fungicides that can be used preemptively as well as after an infection. Dilute the neem solution per the bottle specifications and spray directly on plants to reduce the chances of a botrytis breakout. Neem is a safe compound from a tropical tree, however it can taste pretty gross, so don’t forget to thoroughly wash your berries.<br><br>

        <strong>Powdery Mildew - Podosphaera aphanis:</strong> 
        Treatment:
        - Homemade Baking Soda Spray: This old-time granny remedy is highly effective as long as it includes a secret viscous ingredient (oil or soap) to hold the sodium bicarbonate on the leaf surface. Mix 1 tablespoon baking soda with 1 teaspoon horticultural oil or liquid soap (I like Dr. Bronners) and 1 gallon of water. Spray on the plants every 1-2 weeks.
        - Vinegar Spray: Mix 2-3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar (about 5% acetic acid) in a gallon of water and spray all over plant surfaces. The acidity kills powdery mildew spores.<br><br>

        <strong>Leaf spot - Mycospharella fragariae:</strong> 
        Treatment: Leaf spot is technically “incurable”. Once it’s on your plants, your only goal is to slow the spread. Because this is mostly an aesthetic issue, researchers say that fungicide use isn’t usually warranted. Leaf spot isn’t a huge issue unless you are noticing spots joining together and killing off significant numbers of leaves. At this point, you may want to remove plants and renovate the beds.<br><br>

        <strong>Verticillium Wilt - Verticillium dahliae and V. albo-atrum:</strong> 
        Treatment: Because verticillium wilt can lie dormant in the soil for many years, it isn’t really a treatable disease. There are no fungicides or fumigants that will eliminate the pathogens. Instead, try to optimize your soil health with plenty of microbially-rich compost, or establish new strawberry raised beds or containers.<br><br>

        <strong>Alternaria Fruit Spot - Alternaria alternata:</strong> 
        Treatment: Once alternaria starts attacking your strawberries, they won’t be edible anyways. Remove infected berries and throw them away. Organic copper fungicides are available as a last resort.<br><br>

        <strong>Anthracnose - Colletotrichum sp.:</strong> 
        Treatment: The main control options for anthracnose are copper-based fungicides, however copper can build up to toxic levels in the soil and harm earthworms or soil microbes. The best treatment for anthracnose is removing diseased plants and following the sanitation measures described above.<br>

        <strong>Soft rot or rhizome rot - Pythium aphanidermatum/ P. vexans / P. myriotylum:</strong> 
        Treatment:
        - Treatment of seed rhizomes with mancozeb 0.3% for 30 minutes before storage and once again before planting reduces the incidence of the disease.
        - Cultural practices such as selection of well-drained soils for planting are important for managing the disease, since stagnation of water predisposes the plant to infection.
        - Seed rhizomes are to be selected from disease-free gardens, since the disease is also seed-borne.
        - Once the disease is located in the field, removal of affected clumps and drenching the affected and surrounding beds with mancozeb 0.3% checks the spread of the disease.<br><br>

        <strong>Bacterial wilt - Ralstonia solanacearum:</strong> 
        Treatment:
        - The cultural practices adopted for managing soft rot are also to be adopted for bacterial wilt.
        - The seed rhizomes may be treated with streptocycline 200ppm for 30 minutes and shade dried before planting.
        - Once the disease is noticed in the field all beds should be drenched with Bordeaux mixture 1% or copper oxychloride 0.2%.<br><br>

        <strong>Leaf spot - Phyllosticta zingiberi:</strong> 
        Treatment: The disease can be controlled by spraying Copper oxychloride 0.25 % or Mancozeb 0.2%.<br>
